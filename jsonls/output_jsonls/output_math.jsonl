How many blue marbles were in the bag before I removed some?", "solution": "Let $x$ be the number of blue marbles and $y$ the number of yellow marbles before I added more. We are given that the ratio of blue to yellow is 8:5, so $\\dfrac{x}{y}=\\dfrac{8}{5}$. Additionally, after we remove blue marbles and add yellow marbles the total number of blue marbles and yellow marbles will be $x-12$ and $y+21$ respectively. We're given that at this point the ratio will be $1:3$, so $\\dfrac{x-12}{y+21}=\\dfrac{1}{3}$. Cross multiplying the first equation gives $5x=8y$ and cross multiplying the second gives $3(x-12)=1(y+21)$. Solving two linear equations on two variables is routine; we get the solution $y=15$, $x=24$. Since $x$ represents the number of blue marbles before some were removed, the answer to the problem is just $\\boxed{24}$.", "answer": "Let $B$ be the number of blue marbles and $Y$ be the number of yellow marbles initially.\nWe are given that the ratio of blue marbles to yellow marbles is 8:5. Thus, we can write\n$$\\frac{B}{Y} = \\frac{8}{5}.$$\nThis implies $5B = 8Y$, or $Y = \\frac{5}{8}B$.\n\nIf we remove 12 blue marbles and add 21 yellow marbles, the ratio becomes 1:3.

If we add 21 yellow marbles, we have $15+21=36$ yellow marbles.\nThen the ratio of blue to yellow marbles is $\\frac{12}{36} = \\frac{1}{3}$, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of blue marbles initially was 24.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{24}$"}
