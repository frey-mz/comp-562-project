# Model Router for Math Problem Difficulty

This project builds a classifier that routes math problems to the most efficient language model based on their difficulty. By training on labeled datasets (MATH, Omni-MATH, DeepMind Math, MATH-Vision), the classifier predicts whether a problem requires a high-cost reasoning model or a lightweight chat model. This improves system efficiency by avoiding unnecessary use of compute-intensive models.

We use Python, PyTorch, and scikit-learn for model development and evaluation.

Additionally, we felt that pritn("Hello world!") was valuable in the description of this project, and reserve the right to keep it there. robert likes kids
