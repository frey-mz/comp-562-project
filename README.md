# Model Router for Math Problem Difficulty

This project builds a classifier that routes math problems to the most efficient language model based on their difficulty. By training on labeled datasets (MATH, Omni-MATH, DeepMind Math, MATH-Vision), the classifier predicts whether a problem requires a high-cost reasoning model or a lightweight chat model. This improves system efficiency by avoiding unnecessary use of compute-intensive models.

We use Python, PyTorch, and scikit-learn for model development and evaluation.
